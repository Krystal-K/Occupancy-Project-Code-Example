<b>Background:</b>
<br> This is a website I created for my Senior Design project. The goal of the project is to create an occupancy sensing system that maintains the privacy of people. This occupancy information can then be used to dynamically control the air ventilation settings of the room based on relatively how occupied it is. By doing so, hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of electricty can be saved in large-scale commerical buildings.

<b>Website:</b>
<br> The website utilizes javascript, jquery and bootstrap. It is hosted on and pulls data from Firebase. The website allows you to create a room or associate sensors with a specific room. The user can then view the different rooms and their relevant occupancy information in real-time or historically. The sensors can be turned on/off, deleted or recorded (raw data is stored on Firebase).
